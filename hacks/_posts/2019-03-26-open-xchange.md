Open-Xchange powers a number of different email clients including Comcast, Libero, 1&1 MailXchange, Network Solutions Secure Mail, Namecheap Email Hosting, Mailbox.org, 123-reg Email, acens Correo Professional, Home.pl Cloud Email Xchange, Virgin Media Mail, and Ziggo Mail.

They prefix class and ID names with `ox-` so we can target them with this.
