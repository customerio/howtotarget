```css
_:-webkit-full-screen, _::-webkit-full-page-media, _:future, :root body:not(.Singleton) .your-class-name {
  /* Replace this comment with your styles */
}
```

The stuff before `.body` will target WebKit desktop apps on Mac (Apple Mail and Outlook Mac), then we add `:not(.Singleton)` to remove Apple Mail.

This also targets Spark desktop app.

Note that this will not work for non-Outlook accounts.
