```css
@media screen yahoo{ .foo }
```

Yahoo & AOL remove invalid media query selectors so will render the above as `@media screen {}`. Yahoo doesn't support `max-device-width` which makes it tricky to split mobile but we can use `max-width`.

Be sure to keep the space between `yahoo` and `{`. If you use it without a space (`yahoo{`) then it may also render some of the code in Outlook.com.
