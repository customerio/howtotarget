```css
.netease_mail_readhtml .your-class-name, .netease_mail_readhtml .your-class-name {
  /* Replace this comment with your styles */
}
```

Email is wrapped with `class="netease_mail_readhtml"`. CSS is prefixed with the same but will only apply to the first class in a list. So with this code the first class gets double prefixed, the second one works.
