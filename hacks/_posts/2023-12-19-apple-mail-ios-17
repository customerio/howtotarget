```css
@supports(text-transform: full-width) and (not (-moz-appearance: none)){
  .your-class-name {
    /* Replace this comment with your styles */
  }
}
```

`text-transform: full-width` is only supported in more recent versions of AppleMail. It's also supported in Firefox but adding `(not (-moz-appearance: none))` will remove that.
