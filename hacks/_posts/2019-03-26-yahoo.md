```css
.& .your-class-name {
  /* Replace this comment with your styles */
}
```

Yahoo and AOL will replace the `.&` with their wrapping ID name. It can also be used to target element selectors (like `.&h1{
  /* Replace this comment with your styles */
}`) and the wrapping div itself (with `.&{
  /* Replace this comment with your styles */
}`).
