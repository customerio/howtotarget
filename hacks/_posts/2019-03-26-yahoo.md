```css
.& .your-class-name { /* Replace this comment with your styles */ }
```

Yahoo and AOL will replace the `.&` with their wrapping ID name. It can also be used to target element selectors (like `.&h1{ /* Replace this comment with your styles */ }`) and the wrapping div itself (with `.&{ /* Replace this comment with your styles */ }`).
